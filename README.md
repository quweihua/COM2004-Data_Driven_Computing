The PDF document is an assignment handout for a course identified as COM2004/3004. The assignment involves developing a classifier system that can identify chess pieces on a chessboard from printed diagrams. The students are expected to build and evaluate a system that takes jpeg images of chessboard diagrams and outputs a sequence of labels representing the pieces on each square. The assignment provides labeled datasets for training and evaluation, as well as template code to get started.

The students are tasked with handling two types of data: image files (jpeg images of chessboard diagrams) and label files (JSON format providing labels for training and testing data). The code for the assignment is organized into four Python files: `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `utils.py`, and `system.py`. The students are required to rewrite the `system.py` file to develop the system while not altering the other files.

The assignment outlines a step-by-step plan on how to proceed, including understanding and testing the provided code, working on the training stage, implementing dimensionality reduction, implementing the classifier, and considering the full board classification mode. Additional rules include limitations on file size and permitted Python modules.

Submissions must include the modified `system.py` file and the generated model files. The assignment will be assessed based on feature extraction, square classification, full-board classification, code quality, and overall performance, with each component worth 10 marks out of a total of 50 for the module.

The document also mentions a lateness penalty of 5% per working day and warns against collusion and plagiarism.
